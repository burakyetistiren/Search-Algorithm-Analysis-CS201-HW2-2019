Search Algorithm Analysis

In this homework, the search problem is studied. That is, given an ordered collection of items (i.e.,
a sorted array of integers) and an item of the same type to be searched (key) in this collection, the
problem is to find out if the key exists in the collection or not. If it exists, the solution needs to return
the position of the key (i.e., the index). If not, it needs to return -1.
Two alternative algorithms that solve this problem are discussed below. Each algorithm
has a different time complexity. The goal of this homework is to evaluate the growth rates of both
algorithms using different inputs.

Algorithm 1: Linear search which works in O(N) time, where N is the size of the collection.
Algorithm 2: Binary search which works in O(log N) time, where N is the size of the collection.

Note that the binary search algorithm works on only sorted collections, so the inputs are
always sorted in ascending order for both algorithms.
